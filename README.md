## Road Lane Line Detection System 
This project is a Streamlit-based interactive viewer for visualizing annotated road lane lines from a dataset. It allows users to select images from a training set.


### Features:
 
* Select an image from the dataset's training folder.

* Parse lane annotations from label files (.txt) and project them on the image.

* Overlay detected lanes with distinct colors for better visualization.

* Side-by-side comparison between the original and detected lane images.
